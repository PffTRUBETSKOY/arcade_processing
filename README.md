# About the project
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a condition caused by the buildup of atherosclerotic plaques inside coronary arteries, which can lead to a reduction in blood supply to the heart. It is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The most common diagnostic procedure for CAD is coronary angiography, which uses contrast material and X-rays to observe lesions in the arteries in real-time, allowing for precise detection of stenosis and control of intraventricular interventions and stent insertions. This procedure is useful for planning necessary revascularization procedures based on the calculated occlusion and affected segment of coronary arteries.
